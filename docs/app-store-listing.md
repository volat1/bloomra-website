```
Bloomra is the period tracking app that puts your privacy first.

Your data stays on your device. Period.

Unlike other period apps, Bloomra doesn't require accounts, cloud storage, or data collection. Everything you log stays right on your phone — we couldn't see your data even if we wanted to.

THE INNER SEASONS FRAMEWORK

Bloomra helps you understand your cycle through the lens of Inner Seasons:

• Inner Winter — Rest and introspection during menstruation
• Inner Spring — Rising energy as you move through the follicular phase
• Inner Summer — Peak energy and clarity around ovulation
• Inner Autumn — Grounding energy during the luteal phase

This isn't medical advice — it's a gentle framework for noticing your natural rhythms.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

• Log your period, symptoms, moods, and notes
• See your cycle patterns over time with tree ring visualization
• Understand which "season" you're in today
• Receive personalized daily wisdom and insights
• Export your data whenever you want
• Delete everything by deleting the app

WHAT WE DON'T DO

• Predict ovulation or fertile windows
• Provide fertility or contraception guidance
• Make medical claims or diagnoses
• Collect, store, or sell your data
• Require accounts, emails, or sign-ups

DESIGNED FOR PRIVACY

Period data is sensitive. That's why Bloomra uses 100% local storage with device encryption. No servers, no cloud, no analytics, no tracking. Your cycle is your business.

START WITH 3 MONTHS FREE
